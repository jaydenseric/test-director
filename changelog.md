# test-director changelog

## Next

### Major

- Updated supported Node.js versions to `^10.17.0 || ^12.0.0 || >= 13.7.0`.
- Updated dependencies, some of which require newer Node.js versions than were previously supported.
- The updated [`kleur`](https://npm.im/kleur) dependency causes subtle differences in which environments get colored console output.
- Published files have been reorganized, so previously supported deep imports will need to be rewritten according to the newly documented paths.
- Removed the package `module` field.
- The summary message when tests fail now outputs using `stderr` via `console.error` instead of using `stdout` via `console.info`.

### Patch

- Removed Node.js v13 and added v15 to the versions tested in GitHub Actions CI.
- Simplified the GitHub Actions CI config with the [`npm install-test`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-install-test) command.
- Updated the EditorConfig.
- Use destructuring for `require` of the Node.js `path` API in tests.
- Use the `FORCE_COLOR` environment variable in tests to ensure output is colorized.
- Use the `.ans` file extension for snapshot text files containing ANSI colorization.
- Removed `npm-debug.log` from the `.gitignore` file as npm [v4.2.0](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v4.2.0)+ doesn’t create it in the current working directory.
- When tests fail and the `throwOnFailure` option is used, don’t set the process exit code to `1`.
- Tweaked the order of ANSI escape codes in messages so modifiers come before colors.

## 4.0.1

### Patch

- Updated dependencies.
- Updated Node.js support to `10 - 12 || >= 13.7` to reflect the package `exports` related breaking changes.

## 3.0.1

### Patch

- Updated dev dependencies.
- Added a new [`hard-rejection`](https://npm.im/hard-rejection) dev dependency to ensure unhandled rejections in tests exit the process with an error.

## 3.0.0

### Major

- Updated Node.js support from v8.10+ to v10+.
- Updated the [`stack-utils`](https://npm.im/stack-utils) dependency to v2.
- Use [`coverage-node`](https://npm.im/coverage-node) for test code coverage.

### Major

- Updated Node.js support from v8.5+ to v8.10+.

  - Added `.github/funding.yml` to display a sponsor button in GitHub.
  - Added a `package.json` `funding` field to enable npm CLI funding features.
