## 7.0.0

### Major

- Updated Node.js support to `^12.20.0 || ^14.13.1 || >= 16.0.0`.
- Updated dev dependencies, some of which require newer Node.js versions than previously supported.

### Patch

- Updated dependencies.
- Replaced the package `prepare` script with a `jsdoc` script.
- Added a package `test:jsdoc` script that checks the readme API docs are up to date with the source JSDoc.
- Also run GitHub Actions CI with Node.js v17, and drop v15.
- Prevent outputting the Node.js internal `async Promise.all (index 0)` error stack frame generated by recent Node.js versions that [`stack-utils`](https://npm.im/stack-utils) fails to clean, (see [tapjs/stack-utils#63](https://github.com/tapjs/stack-utils/issues/63)).
- Readme tweaks.

## 6.0.0

### Major

- Updated Node.js support to `^12.20 || >= 14.13`.
- The API is now ESM in `.mjs` files instead of CJS in `.js` files, [accessible via `import` but not `require`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/esm.html#esm_require).
- The `TestDirector` class is now only accessible via a default `import` from the main index.
- The `TesDirector` instance method `add` now throws a `TypeError` if argument 1 `name` is not a string.

### Patch

- Updated dependencies.
- Stop using [`hard-rejection`](https://npm.im/hard-rejection) to detect unhandled `Promise` rejections in tests, as Node.js v15+ does this natively.
- Updated GitHub Actions CI config:
  - Also run tests with Node.js v16.
  - Updated `actions/checkout` to v2.
  - Updated `actions/setup-node` to v2.
  - Don’t specify the `CI` environment variable as it’s set by default.
- Use the regex flag `u`.
- The `TesDirector` instance method `add` now throws a more specific `TypeError` if argument 2 `test` is not a function.
- Stop snapshot testing major Node.js versions separately, as they all produce the same results now.
- Changed the [`snapshot-assertion`](https://npm.im/snapshot-assertion`) link in the readme from GitHub to npm.
- Recommend [`coverage-node`](https://npm.im/coverage-node) in the readme.
- Prettier formatting fix for a code example.
- Whitespace formatting tweaks.
- Linked [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) in the readme.

## 5.0.0

### Major

- Updated supported Node.js versions to `^10.17.0 || ^12.0.0 || >= 13.7.0`.
- Updated dependencies, some of which require newer Node.js versions than were previously supported.
- The updated [`kleur`](https://npm.im/kleur) dependency causes subtle differences in which environments get colored console output.
- Published files have been reorganized, so previously supported deep imports will need to be rewritten according to the newly documented paths.
- Removed the package `module` field.
- The summary message when tests fail now outputs using `stderr` via `console.error` instead of using `stdout` via `console.info`.

### Patch

- Removed Node.js v13 and added v15 to the versions tested in GitHub Actions CI.
- Simplified the GitHub Actions CI config with the [`npm install-test`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-install-test) command.
- Updated the EditorConfig.
- Use destructuring for `require` of the Node.js `path` API in tests.
- Use the `FORCE_COLOR` environment variable in tests to ensure output is colorized.
- Use the `.ans` file extension for snapshot text files containing ANSI colorization.
- Removed `npm-debug.log` from the `.gitignore` file as npm [v4.2.0](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v4.2.0)+ doesn’t create it in the current working directory.
- When tests fail and the `throwOnFailure` option is used, don’t set the process exit code to `1`.
- Tweaked the order of ANSI escape codes in messages so modifiers come before colors.

## 4.0.1

### Patch

- Updated dependencies.
- Updated Node.js support to `10 - 12 || >= 13.7` to reflect the package `exports` related breaking changes.
- Updated the package `exports` field to allow requiring `package.json` and specific deep imports.
- Also run GitHub Actions with Node.js v14.
- Use [`snapshot-assertion`](https://npm.im/snapshot-assertion) for snapshot tests.
- Mention [`snapshot-assertion`](https://npm.im/snapshot-assertion) in the readme.
- Improved the package `prepare:prettier` and `test:prettier` scripts.
- Configured Prettier option `semi` to the default, `true`.

## 4.0.0

### Major

- Added a [package `exports` field](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_package_exports) to support native ESM in Node.js.
- Added package `sideEffects` and `module` fields for bundlers such as webpack.
- Published files have been reorganized, so undocumented deep imports may no longer work.

### Patch

- Updated dependencies.
- Lint fixes for [`prettier`](https://npm.im/prettier) v2.
- Added `esm` and `mjs` to the package `tags` field.
- Ensure GitHub Actions run on pull request.

- Destructure `assert` imports in tests.
- Use file extensions in require paths.
- Tidied the position of a JSDoc comment.

## 3.0.1

### Patch

- Updated dev dependencies.
- Added a new [`hard-rejection`](https://npm.im/hard-rejection) dev dependency to ensure unhandled rejections in tests exit the process with an error.
- Don’t attempt to display an error stack if it’s missing, empty, or the same as the error message.
- Improved code examples.

## 3.0.0

### Major

- Updated Node.js support from v8.10+ to v10+.
- Updated the [`stack-utils`](https://npm.im/stack-utils) dependency to v2.
- Use [`coverage-node`](https://npm.im/coverage-node) for test code coverage.

### Minor

- Support tests throwing unusual error types, such as primitives.
- [`test-director`](https://npm.im/test-director) is now excluded from error traces.

### Patch

- Updated dev dependencies.
- Changed the order of console color codes to color, then modifier.
- Removed the extra newline that trails error stacks.
- Implemented better tests using JS, replacing the shell scripts.
- Updated code examples.

## 2.0.0

### Major

- Updated Node.js support from v8.5+ to v8.10+.
- Replaced the [`chalk`](https://npm.im/chalk) dependency with [`kleur`](https://npm.im/kleur), which has a much smaller install size and outputs cleaner code. Its environment color support detection may behave differently.

### Minor

- Setup [GitHub Sponsors funding](https://github.com/sponsors/jaydenseric):
  - Added `.github/funding.yml` to display a sponsor button in GitHub.
  - Added a `package.json` `funding` field to enable npm CLI funding features.

- Updated dev dependencies.
- Removed the now redundant [`eslint-plugin-import-order-alphabetical`](https://npm.im/eslint-plugin-import-order-alphabetical) dev dependency.
