# test-director changelog

## Next

### Major

- Support Node.js v8.10+.
- Replaced the [`chalk`](https://npm.im/chalk) dependency with [`kleur`](https://npm.im/kleur), which has a much smaller install size and outputs cleaner code. Its environment color support detection may behave differently.

### Minor

- Setup [GitHub Sponsors funding](https://github.com/sponsors/jaydenseric):
  - Added `.github/funding.yml` to display a sponsor button in GitHub.
  - Added a `package.json` `funding` field to enable npm CLI funding features.

### Patch
